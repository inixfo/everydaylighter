Eyebrow: FAQ

# Frequently asked questions.

Answers to common questions about purchases, downloads, accounts, payments, products, and refunds.

## Purchasing

### How do I purchase a product?

Choose the product you want, continue to checkout, enter the required information, and complete payment using one of the available payment methods.

After a successful payment and verification, access will be provided according to the product's delivery method.

### Do I need an account to purchase?

Not necessarily.

Learn by Bluxor supports guest checkout for eligible purchases. Creating or signing into an account makes it easier to keep your purchases together in your library.

### Where can I see my purchases?

Signed-in customers can view their purchases from their account, library, or orders section.

If you purchased as a guest, use the email associated with the order and the available purchase-claim/access process.

## Downloads

### How do I download something I purchased?

After your payment is successfully verified, open the purchased product from your Learn by Bluxor library or the access link provided after purchase.

### My download isn't working. What should I do?

First try refreshing the page, signing back into the correct account, and using an updated browser.

If the problem continues, visit Download Help or contact support with your order information.

### Can I share my downloaded product with someone else?

Unless a product specifically says otherwise, purchases are licensed for the purchaser's own use.

Do not redistribute, resell, publicly upload, or share paid Learn by Bluxor files without permission.

## Accounts

### Can I use Google to sign in?

Yes, when Google sign-in is available you can use it to access Learn by Bluxor.

If the verified Google email matches an eligible existing account, the platform may securely associate the sign-in method with that account.

### I purchased as a guest. Can I create an account later?

Where supported, purchases made using the same verified email may be claimable into your Learn by Bluxor account.

### What if I forget my password?

Use the Forgot password option on the login page and follow the instructions sent to your email.

## Payments

### What happens if my payment fails?

A failed or incomplete payment does not normally activate the purchase.

You can check the order status and try again if appropriate.

If you were charged but access was not provided, contact support before attempting multiple additional payments.

### Is access provided immediately?

Most digital products are made available after the payment provider confirms the transaction and Learn by Bluxor successfully verifies it.

Occasional payment-provider or network delays may delay confirmation.

## Products

### Are the products physical products?

Products sold through Learn by Bluxor are primarily digital unless a product page explicitly states otherwise.

No physical shipment should be expected for a digital-only product.

### Will a product always stay exactly the same?

Digital products may occasionally be corrected, improved, or updated.

The availability of future updates depends on the specific product and does not automatically mean every purchase includes permanent or lifetime updates.

## Refunds

### Can I get a refund?

Because many Learn by Bluxor products are digital and can be accessed immediately, refunds are handled according to the Refund Policy and the circumstances of the purchase.

See: /refund-policy

### What if I purchased the same product twice?

Contact support with the relevant order details. We can review duplicate-payment situations.

Eyebrow: Download Help

# Having trouble accessing your purchase?

Most download and access problems can be solved in a few minutes. Follow these steps before contacting support.

## Step 1

### Confirm the payment completed

Your digital product is normally made available only after the payment has been successfully verified.

Check your order status.

If it is still pending, wait for the payment provider to finish processing before trying to purchase again.

## Step 2

### Make sure you're using the correct account

If you purchased while signed in, log in using the same Learn by Bluxor account.

If you purchased as a guest, use the same email address that was used during checkout when using the available purchase-access or claim process.

## Step 3

### Open your library

Go to:

My Library

Find the purchased product and select its available download/access option.

## Step 4

### Try your browser again

If clicking Download does nothing:

* refresh the page
* disable aggressive popup/download blocking temporarily
* try a current version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari
* try another device or network if necessary

Do not instruct users to disable security software entirely.

## Step 5

### Check your downloads folder

Your browser may download the file without opening it automatically.

Check your browser's download history and device Downloads folder.

## Step 6

### Still not working?

Contact support.

Provide:

* email used for purchase
* order reference if available
* product name
* description of the issue

Do NOT ask customers to send:

* passwords
* full payment credentials
* OTP codes
* authentication codes

## Keep your account secure

Learn by Bluxor support will never need your password, one-time password, or complete payment credentials to help with a download issue.

We do not sell personal information to advertisers.

Only include this statement if the business intends to follow this practice.

## 9. Data retention

We keep information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purpose it was collected, including providing purchases, maintaining account records, resolving disputes, preventing abuse, and meeting applicable legal or accounting obligations.

Retention periods may vary depending on the type of information.

## 10. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect account, purchase, and platform information.

                'content' => <<<'MD'
# Refund Policy

We want customers to understand what they are purchasing and to receive working access to the digital product they paid for.

Because Learn by Bluxor primarily sells digital products that may be delivered or made accessible immediately, refunds are handled based on the circumstances described below.

Nothing in this policy is intended to limit rights that cannot lawfully be excluded under applicable consumer law.

## Digital purchases

Because digital products can become accessible immediately after payment, refund eligibility is more limited than it may be for physical goods.

Each request is reviewed according to this policy and applicable consumer rights.

## When a refund may be considered

### Duplicate payment

You were charged more than once for the same intended purchase.

### Product not delivered

Payment was successfully completed but the purchased digital product was not made available, and we are unable to resolve the access problem.

### File is unusable

A purchased file is materially corrupted or technically unusable and we cannot provide a working replacement.

### Incorrect product delivered

The product delivered is materially different from the product associated with the completed order because of an error on our side.

### Other exceptional circumstances

We may review other reasonable requests individually.

## Situations that normally do not qualify

A refund will not normally be provided simply because:

* you changed your mind after receiving/accessing the digital product
* you did not read the product description before purchasing
* you expected information or features that were not advertised
* you no longer need the product
* you lack the software, device, skill, or third-party service needed to use the product where those requirements were reasonably disclosed
* a third-party platform later changes its interface, pricing, policies, or features
* you purchased the product and then found similar information elsewhere

This does not override rights available under applicable law.

## Before requesting a refund

If your problem involves:

* downloading
* accessing your library
* receiving a file
* payment confirmation

please contact support first.

Many access problems can be resolved without a refund.

## How to request a refund

Go to:

/contact

Provide:

* your name
* purchase email
* order/reference number where available
* product name
* reason for the request

Do not send passwords, OTP codes, or full payment credentials.

## Review process

We may verify:

* the order
* payment status
* delivery/access status
* previous refund activity
* relevant technical records

before making a decision.

If a refund is approved, it will be processed through the available payment/refund process.

Processing time after approval may depend on the payment provider or financial institution.

## Access after refund

When a digital purchase is refunded, access to the corresponding paid product may be removed from the customer's Learn by Bluxor account or library.

## Abuse

We may refuse requests involving apparent:

* refund abuse
* fraudulent transactions
* repeated misuse
* unauthorized redistribution of purchased content

subject to applicable consumer rights and law.

## Questions

If you're unsure whether your situation qualifies, contact us and explain the issue.
